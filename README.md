# Blackjack Program
This is a personal project I made in December 2020 after my 1st semester at NAIT. It is a C# program that allows the user to play the game of Blackjack while providing the user suggestions on what actions they should make in certain situations.
## To Play
1. Open the .sln file
2. Run (debug) the program
3. You will be shown your hand (2 cards facing up) and the dealer's hand (1 card facing up and 1 card facing down)
4. You can Hit (H), Stand (S), or Double (D) 
      - The program will give you suggestions on what to do based off common [Blackjack Strategy charts](https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-strategy-charts/) 
5. Goal is to get a higher number than the dealer that is not greater than 21
